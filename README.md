# SucShop
As fellow small business owners, we understand the difficulties small businesses face when building their self-hosted e-commerce sites — continuously rising subscription fees for e-commerce SaaS, various technical issues, complex payment integrations, SEO challenges, expensive online traffic, and more.

That’s why we created [SucShop](http://sucshop.word-x.com): to help small business owners, solo creators, digital product sellers, and artisans launch their online shops with minimal time and cost. SucShop is fast, lightweight, and intuitive.

With SucShop, you can launch your online shop in just 30 seconds — without struggling with complicated interfaces or endless settings, so you can focus on what truly matters: creating great products and delighting your customers.
